## Using GitHub to Manage Projects

GitHub is a collaborative platform that helps manage coding projects efficiently. With GitHub, you can:

- **Track changes:** Every update to the project is recorded, providing a complete history and the ability to revert changes if needed.
- **Collaborate:** Multiple people can work together, review code, and suggest improvements.
- **Organize work:** Use Issues and Project Boards to manage tasks, bugs, and new features.
- **Share knowledge:** Repositories can be public for open collaboration or private for restricted access, making it ideal for classroom use.

This project demonstrates how GitHub can be a powerful tool for organizing and sharing educational programming projects, as well as facilitating teamwork and version control.
